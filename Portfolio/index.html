            <p>Hello everyone, I'm Ivan Albert! I'm a student currently studying 5th semester of Computer Science Major in Bina Nusantara University. I born on November 29,2001 in Palembang, Indonesia.</p> 
            <br>
            <p>Personally, I found that the act of programming is fascinating and also challenging at the same time. When I first start learn to code, I often find myself spend a lot of time creating a simple solution for study cases at university. Then I made an effort to study harder and be not afraid to ask for my friends and lecturer help since I believe that this is nercessary for my development. As time goes on the act of programming become easier and more clearer to do than before.</p>
            <p>Learning how to code step by step made me realize that I can do a lot of things with it. While my study in my university, I found my passion to learn and develop an attractive and resposive web site and web application</p>
            <br>
            <p>In the future, I'll keep expanding my knowledge even when I already work at company. I'll try to learn and cooperate as best as I could with my colleagues at work so we can grow together in knowledge and experiences</p>
